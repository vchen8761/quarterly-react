    ## Quarterly
    A Google Chrome Extension that reminds users to practice selfcare of hydration, eye strain and posture during this time of self quarantine and social distancing.

    ## Motivation
    Even though we are stuck inside during this time, we should still strive to take care of our body. That means not getting sucked into our devices for too long. Quarterly helps remind us that we should move around a bit.

    ## Build status
    n/a (Not integrated with Travis CI yet)

    ## Tech/framework used/in-progress
    - Javascript (React)
    - HTML
    - CSS/ (SASS soon)
    - Bootstrap (looking into reactstrap)
    - Chrome API


    <b>Built with</b>
    This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
    - [React](https://reactjs.org/)

    ## Features
    Currently only works as a single repeating alert that runs in the background. 

    I plan to expand this tremendously over time.

    ## Code Example
    n/a (I am rebuilding the basic functionality in React framework)

    ## Installation and How to use?
    ### Available Scripts

    In the project directory, you can run:

    #### `npm start`

    Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

    The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
    You will also see any lint errors in the console.

    #### `npm test`

    Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

    #### `npm run build`

    Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
    It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

    The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
    Your app is ready to be deployed!
